# Migration-Trend-Analysis

This project analyzes border encounters at the U.S. southwest land border from 2000 to 2022. The dataset is sourced from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and includes monthly data on encounters for each border sector.

## Project Overview

### Data Acquisition
Collected monthly border encounter data from the CBP for all sectors of the southwest border, including Big Bend, Del Rio, El Paso, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley.

### Policy Analysis
Investigated the impact of two policies:

1. **Title 42**: A public health order that allowed border agents to expel migrants quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Remain in Mexico (Migrant Protection Protocols)**: A policy that required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their U.S. asylum cases were processed.

### Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Methodology
Used a DiD approach to estimate the causal effect of these policies on the number of border encounters, controlling for pre-existing trends.
